# Codex Token Overlay

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Codex Token Overlay is a read-only desktop companion that shows token usage for the task currently selected in Codex Desktop. Windows identifies the foreground conversation from its accessible document title and local session index; macOS follows tasks through Codex's local IPC channel. Both platforms read token metrics from local JSONL session logs, including logs of idle tasks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an unofficial community project. It is not developed, endorsed, or supported by OpenAI. Codex Desktop's accessible document title, session index, JSONL schema, and IPC messages are internal implementation details and may change in a future Codex release.

This repository includes a Windows conversation-switching fix. No Release containing this fix has been published yet; [build from this source](#build-from-source) to use it. Upstream release packages do not include the changes described under Unreleased here.

## Features

- Follows the task selected in Codex Desktop, including a task that is not currently running.
- Refreshes after a task switch even when that task's log has not changed.
- Shows total, input, output, cache-hit, derived cache-miss, reasoning, and context-window token metrics on both platforms, plus cache-hit rate on Windows.
- Lets you choose exactly which fields are visible.
- Uses a compact, no-focus capsule that follows the Codex main window, plus a tray icon on Windows.
- Uses a native menu-bar item on macOS, with launch-at-login control in its menu.
- On Windows, clears old values after detecting a selection change and waits when the visible title cannot uniquely identify a local session.
- On macOS, falls back to the newest root Codex Desktop session when internal IPC is unavailable.
- Reads local state only; it has no telemetry, analytics, network API, or upload feature.

## Windows context remaining and alerts

The Windows overlay now offers a **Context remaining** metric (one decimal place),
shown in the right collapsed slot for new settings. Existing saved field choices
are preserved. The context metric uses the latest request's **input tokens**;
accumulated usage and response output are not counted as the current input context.
Missing context-window data displays an em dash instead of a misleading percentage.

Remaining context of 20%, 10%, and 5% triggers a Windows tray notification. Alerts
are independent per thread and do not repeat for every log update or task switch.
Jumping across multiple thresholds produces only the most severe notification.
A threshold rearms after recovery exceeds it by three percentage points, supporting
compaction without notification noise near a boundary. Deduplication lasts until
application exit. Windows notification settings may suppress notifications.

Use **上下文不足提醒** in the tray menu to toggle alerts. To change thresholds, exit
the overlay, edit `ContextAlertThresholds` in the settings JSON, and restart:

```json
"ContextAlertsEnabled": true,
"ContextAlertThresholds": [20, 10, 5]
```

Automatic alerts require a matching foreground-conversation route, or an explicitly
pinned displayed session. They are suppressed while Windows cannot identify the
selected thread. Values are snapshots of the latest model request, not predictions
of the next request or exact compaction timing.

These additions and the foreground-title routing fix apply to Windows; macOS
task routing and its IPC fallback are unchanged.
See the [Chinese development notes](README.context-monitor.zh-CN.md).

## Downloads

There is currently no download package for this repository's Windows switching fix. The following table describes the original project's [upstream release assets](https://github.com/soleillevant0125/codex-token-overlay/releases); build this source for the fix.

| Platform | Asset | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows x64 Lite | `CodexTokenOverlay-win-x64-lite.zip` | About 100 KB; requires .NET 10 Desktop Runtime. |
| Windows x64 Standalone | `CodexTokenOverlay-win-x64.zip` | About 46 MB; no .NET installation and preserves the existing asset name. |
| Windows Arm64 Lite | `CodexTokenOverlay-win-arm64-lite.zip` | About 100 KB; requires the Arm64 .NET 10 Desktop Runtime. |
| Windows Arm64 Standalone | `CodexTokenOverlay-win-arm64.zip` | No .NET installation and preserves the existing asset name. |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `CodexTokenOverlay-macos-arm64.zip` | Recommended for M1, M2, M3, M4, and later M-series Macs. |
| macOS Intel | `CodexTokenOverlay-macos-x64.zip` | Intel Macs running macOS 14 or later. |

Every ZIP has a neighboring `.sha256` checksum file. Windows Lite is close to the macOS archive size and contains the same application code as Standalone; it uses a shared system runtime instead of embedding it. Install the matching **Desktop Runtime** from [Microsoft's official .NET 10 download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0). Choose the same-architecture asset without `-lite` if you do not want to install a runtime or are unsure.

The Windows Arm64 packages are cross-built and their PE architecture is checked in CI. They should be treated as not yet natively tested on Arm64 hardware until a physical-device test is recorded.

No Windows package requires PowerShell. macOS users do not need Xcode, Swift, or Homebrew.

## Run on Windows

1. Build and publish this source as described below. Use Lite when the matching .NET 10 Desktop Runtime is installed, or Standalone to include the runtime.
2. Extract the generated local archive anywhere, or open its publish directory.
3. Double-click `CodexTokenOverlay.exe`.

The default Windows workflow uses manual main-window attachment. Choose **调整位置和大小…** from the tray, then drag the capsule onto the Codex main window. The nearest of its eight reference points (four corners and four edge midpoints) becomes the saved reference, so the capsule follows that same point and relative offset when the Codex window moves or resizes. A drop over the built-in pet, desktop, another app, or any other non-main Codex surface is invalid: the target highlight clears, the placement cannot be saved, and the capsule immediately returns to its last valid position. Drag the bottom-right handle to resize the entire capsule and expanded panel proportionally from 60% to 130%, including text, spacing, radii, and padding.

Press **Enter** or choose **完成调整** in the tray to save; press **Esc** or choose **取消调整** to restore the complete pre-edit placement and scale. **重置到 Codex 右上** restores the main-window top-right attachment at 100%.

Use **收起时显示 > 左侧指标** and **收起时显示 > 右侧指标** in the tray menu to choose the two values shown while collapsed. The compatibility submenu **传统定位** retains **标题栏右上**, **自动吸附**, **窗口内右上**, and **窗口内右下** for existing workflows. Selecting a traditional placement disables manual attachment until adjustment or reset is used again. The bottom-right traditional placement expands upward. In title-bar mode, the requested scale is reduced only as much as necessary to use the largest scale that fits completely inside the title bar; the overlay never moves into the Codex client area, and the requested scale returns automatically when space permits. Other narrow placements still fall back from two collapsed metrics to one metric and then hidden until space returns.

Click the capsule normally to expand its full metric panel; click it again or click elsewhere to collapse it, while interacting inside the panel keeps it open. The overlay does not take focus from the Codex input box. Its visual attachment is a separate companion window that follows Codex geometry; it is not injected into or embedded in the Codex process or UI tree. It follows the Windows application light/dark setting live, including the capsule, expanded panel, edit decoration, and attachment target ring; there is no manual theme option. It appears only while a recognized Codex Desktop window is in the foreground and hides when Codex loses foreground. The tray menu also controls expanded-panel fields, task locking, temporary visibility, and exit.

**锁定当前会话** pins the conversation whose values are currently displayed. Further task switches keep that conversation's metrics until you uncheck the option. The option is available after a token snapshot has been displayed; it does not pin an unfinished background read.

Unsigned GitHub executables can trigger Windows SmartScreen. Confirm that the file came from this repository and compare its SHA-256 checksum before choosing **More info > Run anyway**.

## Run on macOS

1. Download `CodexTokenOverlay-macos-arm64.zip` for an M-series Mac, or the x64 archive for an Intel Mac.
2. Extract the ZIP and move `CodexTokenOverlay.app` to `/Applications`.
3. Open the app. Its token display appears in the macOS menu bar; there is no Dock icon.
4. Click the menu-bar text to choose fields, lock the current task, enable launch at login, or quit.

The current public macOS archives are ad-hoc signed, not Developer ID notarized. On first launch, Gatekeeper may require you to Control-click the app and choose **Open**, or approve it under **System Settings > Privacy & Security**. Only do this after confirming the download source and checksum. No Terminal command or global security bypass is required.

A Developer ID Application certificate and Apple notarization are required to remove this first-launch trust prompt. The repository is packaging-ready for that step, but no Apple certificate is stored in this project.

## Requirements and file locations

- Windows 10/11, or macOS 14 or later.
- Windows Lite requires the architecture-matching .NET 10 Desktop Runtime; Standalone does not.
- Codex Desktop running under the same interactive user.
- Read access to Codex Desktop's local session data.

The session directory is resolved in this order:

1. `--sessions <path>` when supplied by a developer or test runner.
2. `$CODEX_HOME/sessions` when `CODEX_HOME` is set.
3. The default `~/.codex/sessions` directory.

Windows also reads `session_index.jsonl` beside the resolved `sessions` directory to match the foreground document title to a conversation ID. A missing or unreadable index leaves the display waiting for identification.

The application itself can be stored anywhere, although `/Applications` is recommended on macOS so launch-at-login and Gatekeeper behavior are predictable.

Preferences are stored per user:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexTokenOverlay\settings.json`
- macOS: the standard preferences domain `io.github.soleillevant0125.CodexTokenOverlay`

Developers and test runners can isolate Windows preferences with `--settings <absolute-json-path>`. This argument is developer/test-only and is not needed or exposed as a normal user setting.

## Metrics

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Total | Accumulated `total_token_usage.total_tokens` for the selected task. |
| Input | Accumulated input tokens. |
| Output | Accumulated output tokens. |
| Cache hit | Accumulated cached input tokens; this is a subset of input. |
| Cache hit rate (Windows) | `cached input / input * 100%`, clamped to 0–100%; it is 0% when input is zero or unavailable. It can be selected for the Windows expanded panel or either collapsed slot and is visible by default in new Windows settings. |
| Cache miss | Derived as `max(0, input - cached input)`. |
| Context | Tokens used by the latest model call compared with `model_context_window`. |
| Reasoning | Accumulated reasoning output tokens when present. |
| Task ID | The Codex conversation/thread identifier. |

These values describe local session-log events. They are not an invoice, an API charge calculation, or an authoritative ChatGPT plan-usage counter.

## How task following works

The app never modifies Codex data. Windows uses these steps:

1. Read the foreground Codex main window's `RootWebArea` document name through Windows UI Automation, without controlling the window or changing focus.
2. Match that title exactly to the latest complete record for each conversation ID in `session_index.jsonl`. Multiple IDs with the same title, unknown titles, and unavailable or incomplete index data leave the route unidentified.
3. After detecting a route change, clear the preceding conversation's values and read the matching root-session JSONL file's newest complete `token_count` event. A missing log or token snapshot shows a waiting state.
4. Recheck the foreground window, document title, and index revision before publishing a route. Reject asynchronous log results from an older route or selection generation, including a rapid A → B → A switch or a change to task locking.

Windows targets a 150 ms polling interval for selection and display updates. This is not a guaranteed end-to-end refresh time: a slow accessibility provider, disk reads, or UI scheduling can add delay. A task switch does not require a new log write. Windows waits instead of selecting the most recently written background log. Outside the Codex foreground window, the overlay hides and preserves the last route; it validates the visible conversation again when Codex returns to the foreground.

macOS retains its existing behavior: it connects as a read-only client to `$CODEX_HOME/ipc/ipc.sock`, with compatible legacy socket fallbacks, follows the task ID from local IPC, and parses the matching root-session log. If IPC is unavailable, it shows the newest compatible Codex Desktop root session instead. The app validates that the IPC path is a Unix socket owned by the current user and that its directory is not writable by another user. It only connects; it never creates, deletes, or replaces Codex's socket.

## Privacy

- Session files are read locally and never modified.
- Token values and task identifiers stay on the computer.
- No session content is transmitted by this application.
- No real Codex session log is included in source control or release archives.

Session JSONL files can contain conversation data. Do not upload them when reporting an issue. A symptom description, app version, platform, and Codex Desktop version are usually enough.

## Troubleshooting

### Switching tasks does not update the display

On Windows, check that **锁定当前会话** is unchecked. The visible title must exactly match one conversation in the local session index. Rename conversations with duplicate titles so they can be distinguished, and open a conversation with a completed model response. Unknown titles, missing logs, unavailable UI Automation data, or a partial index write show a waiting state instead of another conversation's numbers. Check `session_index.jsonl` beside the configured `sessions` directory and restart the overlay after changing `CODEX_HOME`. A 150 ms target polling interval does not guarantee completion within 150 ms.

On macOS, selection still comes from internal IPC. Restart both Codex Desktop and the overlay, and check for a newer release if Codex was recently updated. Its fallback can show recent token data but cannot always identify an idle task selected in the UI.

### The macOS menu item says `Token —`

- Open a Codex task that has at least one completed model response.
- Confirm that `~/.codex/sessions` exists, or that your custom `CODEX_HOME` is available to GUI applications.
- Restart the overlay after changing `CODEX_HOME`.
- If IPC has changed in a new Codex build, the menu falls back to the newest compatible root session.

### Remove the application

- Windows: exit from the tray and delete the extracted folder. Optionally remove `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexTokenOverlay`.
- macOS: quit from the menu bar, disable **Launch at login**, and delete `CodexTokenOverlay.app` from `/Applications`.

## Build from source

### Windows

Development requires the .NET 10 SDK:

```powershell
dotnet restore .\src\CodexTokenOverlay\CodexTokenOverlay.csproj
dotnet build .\src\CodexTokenOverlay\CodexTokenOverlay.csproj -c Release
dotnet run --project .\tests\VisibleThreadRouting -c Release
dotnet run --project .\tests\ThreadSwitching -c Release
dotnet run --project .\tests\ContextAlerts -c Release
.\scripts\Test-LogParser.ps1
.\scripts\Test-OverlayLogic.ps1 -Area All
```

The synthetic suites contain 25 title-routing checks, 16 selection/log/locking/late-result checks, and 18 context-alert checks. The existing log-parser and overlay-logic scripts cover the prior behavior. They do not prove latency or compatibility with every Codex Desktop build; actual foreground task switches should also be checked on the target desktop.

Create both local Lite and Standalone archives with:

```powershell
.\scripts\Publish-Local.ps1 -RuntimeIdentifier win-x64 -Variant Both
```

Set `-Variant` to `Lite` or `Standalone` to build only one form.

The publishing script checks PE architecture for both Windows targets and runs the existing executable probes on x64 outputs. Arm64 remains cross-built. To check a separately published x64 executable:

```powershell
.\scripts\Test-PublishedExecutable.ps1 -ExecutablePath .\dist\win-x64\CodexTokenOverlay.exe
.\scripts\Test-PeArchitecture.ps1 -ExecutablePath .\dist\win-x64\CodexTokenOverlay.exe -Architecture x64
```

### macOS

Development requires macOS 14 or later with Xcode Command Line Tools:

```bash
swift test --package-path macos
./script/build_and_run.sh --verify
```

The repository's Codex environment exposes the same script as a **Run** action. To create a release-style `.app` locally:

```bash
./macos/script/package_app.sh \
  --arch "$(uname -m)" \
  --configuration release \
  --version 0.3.0 \
  --output artifacts/macos-local
```
